            <p>
                What pops into your mind when you hear the word "blockchain"? You might be thinking about Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cryptocurrency, etc., BINGOO that absolutely makes sense.
                Blockchain is a decentralized, advanced database mechanism that allows
                transparent, secure, and temper resistant in the form of blocks (records).
                in an immutable format. A block in a blockchain is a data structure that stores
                a set of transactions. Each block consists of elements such as relevant information (data), a hash (unique fingerprints), and a previous hash, and each one is linked to the previous one through a cryptographic hash function, forming a chain of blocks, collectively known as the block chain.

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">History of Blockchain</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
            BlockChain was introduced in 2009 by an anonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. 
            He introduced first cryptocurrency "BitCoin" through the help of blockchain technology .

            <p>
                Fun Fact : Blockchainâ€™s Mysterious Birth: ðŸ˜¶ Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, remains as mysterious as Area 51. We still have no idea if Satoshi is a real person, a group, or an AI from the future!

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">Advantage of blockchain technology</h3>
            <p>
                
Blockchain offers numerous advantages across various industries due to
its unique characteristics. Due to its decentralized nature, it minimizes
the risk associated with a central point of failure, making the system more resilient to attacks, and since no entity has single control over the entire blockchain, it promotes transparency and minimizes the risk of manipulation. Since all the transactions are secured using cryptographic methods, it is very difficult for unauthorized parties to alter the data, and due to its immutable form, it is nearly impossible to alter it without consensus from the network. This system highly promotes auditability, as in blockchain, all the historical records of transactions are readily available for audit purposes. Due to smart contracts, there is also the feature of automated execution in blockchain technology. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms directly written in code that automatically enforce and execute the terms of an agreement when predefined conditions are met.

Imagine you are the candidate in an election that is physical. Your votes are slowly rising up. People prefer you more and are
voting for you, but all of a sudden some people steal your ballot box and destroy it! It's heartbreaking, right? But will you believe?
what I stated is actually true. It's actually aÂ  true event that took place in Rautahat, where the locals looted ballot boxes from two polling stations. The incident took place at the polling center in wards 1 and 2 of Yamunamai Rural Municipality during the course of local-level elections. As a result, voting was canceled in both places.

       <p> <b>What if the voting system was blockchain based ?Would the voting be canceled ? </b></p><p></p>Obviously, it's a big no, as it would be a great, reliable system for voting in various ways. Firstly, the voting system would be very convenient, as people wouldn't have to rely on traditional voting stations and could directly vote from home. As blockchain uses cryptographic algorithms to secure data, once a vote is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, reducing the risk of vote tampering, and the distributed nature of blockchain means that there is no single point of failure, making it more resistant to hacking and fraudulent activities. There is no need to worry about transparency and trust as each vote is recorded on a public ledger, allowing for easy verification and auditing by anyone, which helps build trust in the electoral process, and the immutable nature of blockchain ensures that all votes are permanent and verifiable, increasing confidence in the accuracy of election results. It can also prevent the double-voting problem by ensuring that each voter can cast only one vote using unique cryptographic identifiers, making the election fair enough. Last but not least, voters can verify that their vote was counted correctly and included in the final tally without compromising their privacy. Therefore, implementing a blockchain voting system can address many of the challenges faced by traditional voting systems, enhance the overall electoral process, foster greater trust and participation among voters, and make the election process fair, especially in Nepal, where corruption and fraud happen from time to time.</p>

            <p><b>Imagine studying four years of bachelor degree in Nepal and still waiting another year for getting transcript ?</b></p>
            <p>Academic transcripts from Nepalese universities are frequently issued with considerable delays; some students pursuing bachelor's degrees have to wait up to a year to receive their records. Administrative backlogs, manual processing errors, and bureaucratic inefficiencies are the main causes of these delays. Graduates who require their transcripts for professional certifications, job applications, or additional education are greatly irritated by the protracted wait times. This problem can be solved by implementing blockchain technology, which will create a decentralised, impenetrable system for managing academic records.Blockchainâ€™s immutable ledger allows for the automated issuance and instant verification of transcripts, eliminating the administrative bottlenecks that lead to delays. With each transcript recorded on the blockchain, students can access their verified academic credentials immediately upon graduation. This system not only ensures the security and authenticity of the records but also enhances transparency and trust in the credentialing process. By adopting blockchain technology, Nepalese universities can significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of transcript issuance, providing timely access to essential academic documents and better supporting their graduatesâ€™ career and educational aspirations. </p>
